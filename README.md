# Bangla-Text-Summarizer

Project Title: Bangla Text Summarizer

Project Description: Information over Internet and offline are increasing so rapidly. Therefore, finding out the essence of these information is very much pain-staking.
It is not feasible to sieve useful information from the large amount of data coming from any source of documents. The only way is to summarize these data is through automated
text summarization process.

Automated Text Summarization is a technique of summarizing any document or text automatically. Summarized text is the concise form of the given text. In Natural Language 
Processing many text summarization techniques are available for English language, but only a few for Bangla language. Bangla is one of the most spoken and used language all 
over the world.

Most of the text summarization techniques are implemented in two different ways, known as abstractive or extractive approach. My “Bangla Text Summarizer” tool will deal with the summarization of Bangla text based on extractive method.

Here I am going to use the algorithm proposed by Md. Iftekharul Alam Efat, Mohammad Ibrahim, Humayun Kayesh in “Automated Bangla Text Summarization by Sentence Scoring and Ranking” published in 2013 International Conference on Informatics, Electronics and Vision (ICIEV)
